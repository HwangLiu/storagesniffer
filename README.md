# StorageSniffer
Mush item sharing tool.
You need Tampermonkey extension installed first. Tested on Tampermonkey for Chrome and Opera - both had no issues. Greasemonkey for Firefox doesn't work with this script, but you probably don't use it for mush, because Ctrl+W doesn't work with it for the same reason (bugged style interpretation).

I'd like to release this Mush extention with full functionality i have in mind, but Mush is going to die in a month, so Version 1.1 has only basic features.
Storage Sniffer collects items from the shelves and shares the list with other players.
Personal or hidden items won't be displayed.
Spored food - unknown, i couldn't check if Storage Sniffer shares infection status of the food, so you better not share your spored food with others. I'll check that when i become a mush. Or i won't, because of the game is going to close.

Simple to use:
1) On a new ship expand menu << and press New to generate a new ship ID.
2) Share this ship ID in chat with other players.
3) If you are one of the "other players", copy Ship ID and insert it into the input field and press Add button.
4) Now you can share items with others and check item location in Storage menu (bag icon button).
